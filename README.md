# DREAM3DDocker

This repository contains Docker image scripts for the
[DREAM.3D](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/) SDK and
DREAM.3D.

These images are useful for development of DREAM.3D and DREAM.3D plugins on
Linux. They are also useful for continuous integration testing. For an example
of GitHub continuous integration testing of a plugin see
[ITKImageProcessing](https://github.com/BlueQuartzSoftware/ITKImageProcessing/blob/develop/circle.yml).
It can also be used to serve DREAM.3D locally in a browser or over a network
with an HTML5 VNC service. To start the web service, execute the `run.sh`
script.
